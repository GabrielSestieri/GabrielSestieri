### Information problem:

We want to give students and faculty better information about where they are spending their time, there is not enough info given in UMPD alerts, our goal is to give residents of the area an easier way to stay up to date on the crime in their area.

### Stake Holders:

Residents of Prince Georges County

UMD Students and the families

### Data:

Prince Georgeâ€™s County crime API

### Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem

Interactive Map

Search/filtering functions

Extra statistics on the crime and area

### Technical system decision rationale

We wanted to solve the problem of accessibility to information, in a specific way for UMD students. There are many UMD focused applications that students currently use so we thought that this choice would be familiar and helpful to students

### How/if your final system helps to address the problem

Our system addresses the problem by creating and interactive map that gives details about past crimes in the area, letting users have a better understanding of their area, and letting them stay up to date.

### Challenges faced and impact on final design

Finding a quality dataset

Creating user inputs

Using JS to implement more indepth statistics and filters.

### Possible future work directions with this problem

Creating more in depth filtering

Allowing users to input crime

Finding a dataset that is more comprehensive and covers a larger area

Increased accessibility on all devices

Creating more efficient system for updating data

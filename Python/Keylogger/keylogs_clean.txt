hello and thanks for checking out my keylogger
this is my unedited keylog file but as i press the key enter
it cleans the file
but as you can see it only works after pressing enter so that is something i need to fix
or else i might miss sKey.backspaceimportant words a user is typing
thinkKey.backspacegs like the backspace key also need to be edited out anf Key.backspaceKey.backspaced replaced with their functionality
Key.shiftKey.cmd5

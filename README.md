# Gabriel Sestieri
This is where I will be adding and working on projects and scripts in my free time to build a portfolio. 

## Python
The Python folder is obviously where all my python projects are. These include:

	1. Connect4
		A simple Connect 4 game.

	2. Drug Interaction
		Uses requests to access the NIH interaction API, cross references interactions of specified drug, and outputs all interactions into a new text file.

	3. Hangman
		A simple hangman game that generates a random word from a text file and gives the user three tries to guess it.
	
	4. Basketball Predictor
		Allows the user to input two NBA teams and will output several bar graphs comparing team stats and a pie char predicting who would win between the two. teams based on stats.

	5. Robot Fight
		A rudimentary robot fight simulation containing two classes. 

## JavaScript
This is where all my worthy JavaScript projects are showcased. They are subject to constant updates.

	1. CrimeTracker
		A webapp that uses Google Maps' API and Prince George's county crime data to pinpoint crime around a given address. Can be filtered based on crimes. Has bugs.

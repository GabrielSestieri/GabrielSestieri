# Gabriel Sestieri
This is where I will be adding and working on projects and scripts in my free time to build a portfolio. 

## Python
The python folder is obviously where all my python projects are. These include:

	1. Connect4
		A simple Connect 4 game.

	2. Drug Interaction
		Uses requests to access the NIH interaction API, cross references interactions of specified drug, and outputs all interactions into a new text file.

	3. Hangman
		A simple hangman game that generates a random word from a text file and gives the user three tries to guess it.
